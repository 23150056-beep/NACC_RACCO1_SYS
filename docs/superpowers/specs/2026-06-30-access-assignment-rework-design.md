# Access, Assignment & Instrument Rework — Design Spec

**Date:** 2026-06-30
**Status:** Draft for review
**Type:** Foundational (the reporting feature — `2026-06-30-assessment-reporting-design.md` — layers on top of this and should be built after it).

---

## 1. Goal & Motivation

Make **assignment govern access** so each role's functions are real and privacy-respecting. Today the codebase intends this but defers it — `RecordsAccess` literally notes *"Per-psychologist 'assigned only' filtering is deferred."* Current gaps:
- **Children:** every psychologist sees **all** records (no `assigned_psychologist` filter).
- **Assessments:** a psychologist sees only assessments **they authored**, but can pick **any** child to assess.
- **Instruments:** every assessment-taker sees **all** active instruments — no ownership/targeting.

This rework finishes the intended RBAC: psychologists are isolated to their assigned children across every function, instruments are owned per-psychologist, and reassignment is an explicit, auditable action. It also bundles three small assessment-area UX refinements.

---

## 2. Scope

### In scope
1. **Psychologist isolation** to assigned children across Records, Assessment-taking, Results, and Dashboard.
2. **Assignment / reassignment workflow** (admin + staff), including a per-reassignment **"carry history?"** choice.
3. **Instrument ownership** — each instrument owned by exactly one psychologist (owner-only model).
4. **Server-side enforcement** (querysets + serializer validation), not just hidden UI.
5. **UX refinements:** (a) move "Assessment Instruments" nav into Casework below Records; (b) "View Results" shortcut on the Assessment page; (c) answers recap on Review & Sign.
6. **Role-scoped notifications** — admin (all), staff (case-coordination stream), psychologist (only events targeted to them, e.g., a new assigned child immediately).

### Out of scope
- The reporting feature itself (separate spec) — though this makes its "assigned children" assumptions real.
- The edit-with-audit lock (`is_locked`) — defined in the reporting spec.
- Multiple psychologists per child (a child has exactly **one** assigned psychologist at a time).
- Behavior-taxonomy instrument matching (rejected in favor of owner-only).

## 3. Role / Access Matrix

| Area | Psychologist | Admin | Staff |
|---|---|---|---|
| Records (children) | only `assigned_psychologist = self` | all | all |
| Assign / reassign psychologist | — | ✅ | ✅ |
| Take assessment | only **assigned** children + **owned** instruments | ✗ (psychologists only) | ✗ (cannot take) |
| Assessment results | own assigned children's, per carry-history rule | all | all (read-only) |
| Instruments | only ones they **own** | all + set/reassign owner | ✗ |
| Dashboard | metrics over assigned children | agency-wide | agency-wide |

> Admin + Staff keep **full access** (they create records and do the assigning). Only Psychologists are isolated.

---

## 4. Data Model Changes

- **`Questionnaire.owner`** → `ForeignKey(User, on_delete=SET_NULL, null=True, blank=True, related_name="owned_instruments")` — the one psychologist who owns the instrument. Null allowed for legacy rows (admin assigns later); SET_NULL so archiving/removing a user never deletes instruments.
- **`Child.assignee_sees_history`** → `BooleanField(default=True)` — set at (re)assignment; controls whether the **current** assignee sees the child's prior assessments.
- **`ActivityLog.recipient`** → `ForeignKey(User, null=True, blank=True, on_delete=SET_NULL, related_name="notifications")` — directs a notification at a specific user (e.g., the newly assigned psychologist).
- Migrations: `assessments/000X_questionnaire_owner.py`, `children/000X_child_assignee_sees_history.py`, `activity/000X_activitylog_recipient.py`.

---

## 5. Access Rules (the heart)

**Records (`ChildViewSet.get_queryset` + object-level):**
- Psychologist → `Child.objects.filter(assigned_psychologist=self)`; Admin/Staff → all (existing archived filter unchanged).

**Assessment results (`AssessmentViewSet.get_queryset`, list/retrieve):**
- Psychologist → `Assessment.objects.filter(child__assigned_psychologist=self).filter(Q(child__assignee_sees_history=True) | Q(psychologist=self))`.
  - So with **carry = yes**, the assignee sees the child's full history; with **carry = no**, only assessments they authored for that child.
- Admin/Staff → all.

**Take assessment (`AssessmentWriteSerializer.validate`) — psychologists only (`ASSESSMENT_TAKER_ROLES = (Psychologist,)`):**
- Reject unless `child.assigned_psychologist == request.user` (`"That child is not assigned to you."`).
- Reject unless `questionnaire.owner == request.user` (`"That instrument is not yours."`).

**Instruments (`QuestionnaireViewSet` + `ActiveQuestionnaireListView`):**
- Psychologist → `filter(owner=self)`; Admin → all.
- Create: Psychologist → `owner` forced to `self`; Admin → `owner` taken from payload (required, must be a Psychologist).
- Admin may edit `owner` (reassign an instrument).

**Dashboard:** psychologist aggregates computed over `assigned_psychologist = self` children; admin/staff agency-wide (the reporting summary endpoint).

---

## 6. Assignment & Reassignment Workflow

- Admin/Staff set `assigned_psychologist` on a child (existing `psychologist` field in `ChildSerializer`).
- On **(re)assignment**, the UI presents **"Carry this child's assessment history over to the new psychologist?"** → writes `assignee_sees_history` (yes = True, no = False).
- The change is logged to the activity feed (`updated`, record, Child).
- Every assessment always keeps its original `psychologist` (author), so per-psychologist reporting stays accurate regardless of reassignment.

---

## 7. UX Refinements

1. **Navigation** (`Sidebar.jsx`): move **Assessment Instruments** from the Clinical section into **Casework**, directly below **Records**. Resulting groups: Casework = Records → Assessment Instruments; Clinical = Assessment → Assessment Results. (Governance drops Compliance & Audit per the reporting decision.)
2. **Assessment page shortcut** (`Assessment.jsx`): add a **"View Results"** button at the top that navigates to `/report` (Assessment Results).
3. **Review & Sign answers recap** (`Assessment.jsx` step 4): render a **read-only list of every question and the answer given** (from the wizard's local `answers` state — no backend change), so the psychologist reviews responses before signing. Satisfies the adviser's "psychologists can review children's assessment answers."

---

## 7.5 Notification Scoping

The activity log doubles as both the **audit trail** (admin) and the **notification feed** (the Topbar bell). It becomes role-aware:

| Role | Notification feed |
|---|---|
| **Admin** | All events (full audit stream) — unchanged. |
| **Staff** | Case-coordination stream: child-record events (created/updated/archived) + "assessment signed". Excludes security/login, user-management, and instrument events. |
| **Psychologist** | Only events where `recipient = self`: a new child assigned to them (immediate), changes to their assigned children's records, and an instrument assigned to them. Nothing else. |

**Recipient-setting rules (when logging):**
- Child **(re)assigned** to psychologist P → event with `recipient = P` ("You were assigned [child]"), created immediately.
- Child record **created/updated/archived** → `recipient = child.assigned_psychologist` (if set).
- Instrument **owner set/changed** by admin → `recipient = owner`.
- "Assessment signed" stays a staff/admin stream event (the authoring psychologist took the action themselves).

**Feed query (`ActivityLogViewSet.get_queryset`):**
- Admin → all.
- Staff → `category = record` AND `entity_type in (Child, Guardian, Assessment)`.
- Psychologist → `recipient = request.user`.

"Immediate" = the event is created the instant it happens and appears on the bell's next refresh (existing polling); real-time websocket push is out of scope.

## 8. Backend Changes Summary

- Models + migrations (§4).
- `children/views.py` — scope `ChildViewSet.get_queryset` for psychologists.
- `accounts/permissions.py` — `ASSESSMENT_TAKER_ROLES = (Role.PSYCHOLOGIST,)` (remove Administrator; taking + analyze are psychologist-only).
- `assessments/views.py` — scope `AssessmentViewSet.get_queryset` (carry-history rule), scope `QuestionnaireViewSet.get_queryset` + `ActiveQuestionnaireListView` by owner, force/require `owner` on create.
- `assessments/serializers.py` — add `owner` to `QuestionnaireSerializer`; add assigned-child + owned-instrument validation to `AssessmentWriteSerializer`.
- `children/serializers.py` — expose `assignee_sees_history` (write) on `ChildSerializer`.
- Activity logging on (re)assignment.
- `activity/` — add `recipient` to `ActivityLog`; role-scope `ActivityLogViewSet.get_queryset` (admin all / staff case-stream / psychologist `recipient=self`); set `recipient` in logging calls per §7.5.

## 9. Frontend Changes Summary

- `Children.jsx` — list now shows only the psychologist's caseload (backend-driven); the Assign Psychologist control gains the **carry-history** toggle on reassignment.
- `Assessment.jsx` — child + instrument pickers are auto-scoped (backend), plus the View Results shortcut and the answers recap.
- `Questionnaires.jsx` (Instruments) — psychologist sees own; admin sees all with an **owner** column + owner picker on create.
- `Sidebar.jsx` — nav move.
- Dashboard — psychologist view scoped to caseload.
- Topbar notifications — feed is now server-scoped per role; simplify the bell's category tabs for non-admins (psychologist/staff don't need the Users/Security tabs).

---

## 10. Relationship to the Reporting Spec

The reporting spec's **Child Progress Report** (psychologist sees "assigned/own") and **Agency Summary** (admin/staff, full) already assume this model — this rework makes it real. Per-psychologist agency stats attribute by assessment author and are unaffected by reassignment. Build this spec **first**, then reporting on top.

---

## 11. Testing

- **Records scoping:** psychologist sees only assigned children; cannot retrieve an unassigned child by id (object-level 404/403).
- **Assessment results carry-history:** with `assignee_sees_history=True`, new assignee sees full history; with `False`, only own-authored; author attribution preserved.
- **Take-assessment validation:** rejects an unassigned child and an unowned instrument; admin bypasses.
- **Instrument ownership:** psychologist sees/manages only owned; create forces owner=self; admin can set/reassign owner.
- **Reassignment:** flag set correctly; activity logged.
- **UX:** manual verification via run/preview per role (caseload scoping visible, nav placement, View Results shortcut, answers recap on sign).

---

## 12. Success Criteria

1. A psychologist sees **only their assigned children** in Records, the assessment child-picker, Results, and Dashboard — and cannot reach others' data via direct API calls.
2. A psychologist sees/uses **only instruments they own**; admin can create instruments for, and reassign them between, psychologists.
3. Reassigning a child offers the **carry-history** choice and it governs what the new psychologist sees.
4. The three UX refinements are in place (nav move, View Results shortcut, answers recap).
5. Notifications are role-scoped: a psychologist is notified immediately when a child is assigned to them and sees only their own; staff see the case-coordination stream; admin sees all.
6. All new access rules are covered by passing backend tests.

---

## 13. Resolved Decisions
- **Assessment-taking is psychologist-only** — `ASSESSMENT_TAKER_ROLES = (Role.PSYCHOLOGIST,)`; admins no longer take or analyze assessments (they oversee/report).
- **Staff can flip carry-history** — both Admin and Staff assign/reassign and set the "carry history?" choice.
